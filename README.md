# BellLabs - A tasklist UI app

I design this to showcase my **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** skills.

Note: **It's totally custom design and not influenced from anywhere**

**Project Description:**

- This a simple application with a dasboard, employee data and tasks.
- Whatever happens in the application, everything is on the client side. It has no backend.
- This application uses the client browser's **local storage** to perform operations and store data.
- In this, the user can perform **CRUD** operations, such as adding, editing and deleting tasks. User can also save it so that it can be seen again later.
- Added search functionality, so that user can search about employees. 

**Technology** used:
